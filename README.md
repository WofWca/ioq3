It's a port of Quake III to the web, based on [ioquake3](https://ioquake3.org). Some of the most important changes have been upstreamed, but there are a lot of random little modifications here. The goal is for this to be the definitive web port of the Quake III engine, with performance and multiplayer as good as native on modern machines, and with support for web essentials such as mobile touch controls.
